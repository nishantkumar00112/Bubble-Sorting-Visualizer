# Bubble Sorting Visualizer Website

This project demonstrates the process of the bubble sort algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive and educational way for users to visualize how the bubble sort algorithm sorts elements in an array.

# Introduction
Bubble Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application designed to help users understand the bubble sort algorithm visually. The website generates a random array of elements and displays them as bars, with each bar's height representing the value of an element in the array. As the algorithm progresses, users can observe how the bars move and swap positions until the array is sorted.

# Features
Visual representation of the bubble sort algorithm.
Random array generation for visualization.
Interactive "play/pause" button to initiate the sorting process.
Clear visualization and concise codebase for easy comprehension.

# Usage
Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.
Click on the "play/pause" button to begin the visualization.
Watch as the bars representing array elements swap positions, demonstrating the bubble sort algorithm step by step.
